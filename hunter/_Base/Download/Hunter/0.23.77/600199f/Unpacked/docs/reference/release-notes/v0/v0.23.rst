v0.23.X
-------

* Ninja generator learn to use :ref:`HUNTER_JOBS_NUMBER <hunter jobs number>`

* New variable
  :ref:`HUNTER_NO_TOOLCHAIN_ID_RECALCULATION <hunter no toolchain id recalculation>`

Internal changes
================

* Internal cache files forced to use ``LF`` line ending. Effectively it means
  that cache files built on Windows now will use ``LF`` instead of ``CRLF``
  and **all cache from Windows became invalid**. Unified ``LF`` line ending
  allow to share cache between macOS/Linux and Windows platforms.

New packages and updates
========================
