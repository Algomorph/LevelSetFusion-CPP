/**
 * @brief Different interpolation methods used to generate the TSDF (might change to "FilteringMethod" in the future)
 *
 * @details EWA methods generate a the TSDF field using Elliptical Weighed Average resampling approach on the depth values.
 * A 3D Gaussian (standard deviation of 1 voxel) around every voxel is projected onto the depth image, the resulting
 * projection is convolved with a 2D Gaussian (standard deviation of 1 pixel), the resulting gaussian is used
 * as a weighted-average filter to sample in different ways, as described further.
 *
